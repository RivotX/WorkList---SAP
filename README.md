# SAP UI5 Application

This project is a small practice exercise I completed with SAPUI5.


## Requirements

Either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management.

## Preparation

Use `npm` (or `yarn`) to install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

(To use yarn, just do `yarn` instead.)

## Run the App

Execute the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):

```sh
npm start
```

As shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html. A browser window with this URL should automatically open.

(When using yarn, do `yarn start` instead.)
